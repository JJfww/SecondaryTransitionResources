<p>We trust this guide will be invaluable in your efforts. Your dedication to our students' success is deeply appreciated!</p>
<hr />
<p>As you build your schedule, keep in mind the importance of <strong>routines</strong>. Routines and structure serve as a stable foundation for many of our students, offering a sense of predictability and security. This, in turn, fosters a supportive environment in which they can develop critical life skills, adapt to changes, and become more self-sufficient.</p>
<p>Here are some <strong>SAMPLE</strong> schedules to guide you as you begin to build your class's schedule. Of course, you can modifiy and adjust as students begin working in their community work experience, as club activities get added to the calendar, and as you get to know your students and their needs.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="monthly-themes"><a class="header" href="#monthly-themes">Monthly Themes</a></h1>
<p>The monthly themes in our curriculum section cover a range of relevant topics for young adults transitioning to adulthood. Each theme provides an opportunity for additional focus on specific areas, but the topics can also be integrated throughout the year as needed.</p>
<p>For example, in August, our focus is on personal preferences and interests, as well as team building activities. This is an important time for our students to explore their passions and learn more about themselves, while also developing important social and communication skills. In November, more focus will be given to important social skills. This theme is designed to help our students develop the skills they need to navigate social situations and build positive relationships with others.</p>
<p>Other themes throughout the year include topics such as personal safety, sex education, self-advocacy, and community involvement. Each theme is designed to provide a comprehensive and engaging learning experience that will help our students prepare for the challenges and opportunities that await them after they exit the school system. </p>
<p>By focusing on these themes throughout the year, we are able to provide a consistent and meaningful educational experience for our students, while also creating opportunities for continued growth and development. What we learn about our students during these themes can carry over throughout the year, providing a strong foundation for success.</p>

<p>Modify/adapt to meet your students' needs. Include your paras in the activities! </p>
<ol>
<li>Sensory scavenger hunt: Create a list of items with different sensory characteristics (e.g., soft, smooth, rough, warm, cold) that can be found in the environment. Participants work in pairs or small groups to find and collect these items. This activity encourages communication and teamwork while engaging various senses.</li>
<li>The name game: Each participant introduces themselves and shares a word or phrase that starts with the same letter as their name (e.g., &quot;Friendly Fred&quot;). As each person introduces themselves, the group must repeat the previous names and adjectives. This activity helps participants remember each other's names and encourages listening skills.</li>
<li>Collaborative art project: Participants work together to create a group art piece, such as a mural or collage. Encourage them to communicate their ideas and preferences, either verbally or non-verbally. This activity fosters teamwork, creativity, and self-expression.</li>
<li>Two truths and a lie: Each participant shares three statements about themselves – two truths and one lie. The rest of the group tries to guess which statement is the lie. This activity encourages sharing and helps participants learn more about each other.</li>
<li>Would you rather: Participants take turns asking &quot;Would you rather&quot; questions (e.g., &quot;Would you rather be able to fly or be invisible?&quot;). Everyone answers the question, and it can spark interesting discussions and help the group learn more about each other's preferences.</li>
<li>Common ground: Participants are given a list of topics (e.g., favorite movies, hobbies, travel destinations) and must find things they have in common with others in the group. This activity encourages communication and helps participants find shared interests.</li>
<li>Find someone who: Create a list of statements such as &quot;Find someone who has a pet,&quot; &quot;Find someone who has traveled to another country,&quot; or &quot;Find someone who plays a musical instrument.&quot; Participants must find someone in the group who matches each statement and write their names down. This activity encourages mingling and conversation.</li>

<p>Why should we teach our students to lead their own IEPs? </p>
<p>Student-led IEPs are important for students with disabilities for several reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p><strong>Empowerment and self-advocacy</strong>: Student-led IEPs involve students in the decision-making process, encouraging them to advocate for their own needs and preferences. This empowers them to take ownership of their education and builds self-confidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Self-awareness</strong>: Participating in the IEP process helps students with disabilities develop a better understanding of their strengths, challenges, and accommodations. This self-awareness enables them to be more effective in their learning and to communicate their needs more effectively.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Goal-setting and self-determination</strong>: Student-led IEPs help students set their own goals and develop strategies to achieve them. This promotes self-determination and encourages students to take responsibility for their progress.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Enhanced communication</strong>: Involving students in the IEP process promotes open communication between students, parents, teachers, and other support staff. This collaboration helps to ensure that everyone is working together to meet the student's needs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Greater engagement</strong>: When students are actively involved in their IEP, they are more likely to be engaged and invested in their education. This leads to better academic performance and improved social-emotional outcomes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Transition planning</strong>: Student-led IEPs help prepare students for post-secondary education, employment, and independent living. By involving students in the planning process, they are better prepared to make decisions about their future and navigate the challenges that may arise.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Personalized learning</strong>: Student-led IEPs prioritize the student's individual needs, ensuring that their education is tailored to their unique strengths and challenges. This personalized approach helps to maximize their potential and promote academic success.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In summary, student-led IEPs are crucial for students with disabilities because they empower them, encourage self-advocacy, and promote self-awareness, goal-setting, and self-determination. Additionally, these IEPs foster communication, engagement, and personalized learning, all while preparing students for the future.</p>
<p>Below are some resources to help you help your students lead their IEPs. </p>

<p><a href="StudentLedIEP.pdf">How to Help Students Lead Their IEP Meetings</a> is a great article from Teaching Exceptional Children that outlines steps you can take to implement student led IEPs in your practice. </p>

<p>When we focus on goal setting and planning, helping our students to develop a roadmap for their future and set achievable goals that will help them reach their full potential.</p>

<p>Here, you will find information on available transition assessments. The purpose is to help teachers access simple tools that allow them to capture transition-related services and activities happening in the classroom, during community-based instruction, and throughout a student's school year. Authentic assessments can help inform transition and transition IEP decision-making.</p>
<p>The resource will cover a variety of assessments, including parent surveys, education, self-determination, independent living, and employment/vocational. These assessments are designed to be simple tools that can be used to gather information on a student's transition-related skills and abilities. By gathering information from multiple settings, teachers can help ensure that their students are prepared for a wide range of post-secondary options.</p>
<p>One key benefit of using authentic assessments is that they help provide a more complete picture of a student's strengths and areas for improvement. By gathering information from multiple sources, such as parents, teachers, and the students themselves, teachers can gain a better understanding of the student's abilities and needs. By using authentic assessments, teachers and IEP teams can make more informed decisions about transition planning and help ensure that students are prepared for success after graduation.</p>
